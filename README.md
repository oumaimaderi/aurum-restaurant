# aurum-restaurant

## Important Note
This is just a concept website for a fictional luxury restaurant called "AURUM". None of this is real - the restaurant doesn't exist, the menu items are made up, and you cannot actually make reservations. This was created as a web development practice project.

## What This Project Is
A multi-page website for a pretend high-end restaurant. It has a homepage, about page, menu, gallery, reservations page, and contact page. The design uses dark navy and gold colors to look fancy and elegant.

## Pages Included
- Home - Landing page with hero section and features
- About - Restaurant story and chef info
- Menu - Food and wine listings
- Gallery - Photo grid of dishes and interior
- Reservations - Booking form
- Contact - Location and contact form

## How I Built It
- HTML5 for the structure
- CSS3 for styling
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Google Fonts for typography
- Media queries to make it work on phones and tablets
- Separate CSS files for each page (plus one global file)

## File Structure
